Yocto meta-layer for RealSense
============================
This meta-layer adds the packages necessary to support IntelÂ® RealSense RS4XX  depth cameras.The support is provided by means of Intel cross-platform [LibRealSense API](https://github.intel.com/PerCHW/librealsense).
This layer can later be extended to include RealSense [Linux SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense_sdk) and Middleware to your Yocto-based distribution.

Note for OEM - that LibrealSense library for RS4xx devices is not in publicly available at this time, and accessing it requires ```github.intel.com```.
Please refer to your Intel POC for details.

## Dependencies
This layer depends on packages provided by the following layers:
* `meta-openembedded` [http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/]

In addition, LibrealSense build recipe is dependent on the following packages:
* `libusb` and `libpng` - provide LibRealSense core
* `glfw` - is required for GUI-based demos and tutorials

Note for Yocto maintainers: `glfw`



Usage

### Ostro OS
1. Checkout the `master` branch to your project directory
2. Add the `meta-intel-realsense` layer to `conf/bblayers.conf` in your `build` directory
```bitbake
	OSTRO_LAYERS += "path/to/meta-intel-realsense"
```
3. If you are building an image with a graphical desktop you can add the following to `conf/auto.conf`
```bitbake
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "librealsense-graphical-examples"
```

### Building a reference Ostro image with this layer embedded:
1. sdfgsdgfsf
2. sfdsfsf
